# budgettracker

This is an app to help a user track their spending/income, regardless of their internet connection. It uses MongoDB to establish a database to keep track of information, and then incorporates PWA to make it even more user friendly and accessible. Given a user would like to track their finances, they are able to access the application, make a note describing the transaction, the transaction amount, and whether it was a transaction that added or subtracted funds from their budget. Each transaction is tracked in a table and the corresponding information is compiled and displayed in an easy to read chart. If a user happens to using the site without internet connection, the information that they input will be stored in the offline database and then applied to the database once a connection is reestablished. Should a user enjoy this application so much that they want to be able to access it easily from their desktop, they may opt to install the site to their computer.
